Original Release Date: January 14, 1995Story-----Saric, a servant of the Ambassador of Kish, had been aboard the ship Seraphim, en route to the kingdom of Zarin. A great storm arose, however, blackening the sky with great billows. Rain smashed across the decks day and night, as if it planned to torture the ship before smashing it across whatever land was handy. Sometime near the peak of the storm, Saric ventured out on deck, partly from curiosity, and partly from a need for fresh air. As he was leaning against the rail, he and several other crew members were lifted from his feet by a huge wave and dashed overboard. Struggling to the surface, Saric saw that the ship was already passing away, too far to reach.Sure that he was doomed, Saric was relieved when he caught sight of one of the sailors, clinging to a piece of flotsam. He and the sailor clung to the barrel, simply drifting with the current, as neither had either knowledge of the direction of land, nor the strength to seek it out. As dawn broke, Saric could see a most welcome sight ahead: Land! A beach pink on the horizon beckoned to him and the sailor. The two swam with all their might, and now, on the beach at last, Saric has recovered his wits, but the sailor, fatigued and suffering from injuries incurred as he was washed overboard, is dying.Now Saric wonders where he is, whether this is the land of Zarin, and how he can possibly find his master, the Ambassador, again.Movement--------Both the arrow keys and the keypad can be used to help you move Saric around the screen.On Mac OS X, holding the Option key makes Saric run whenever it is held down with one of the movement keys. Holding the Alt key on Windows does likewise. Keep in mind that running for too long will deplete Saric's stamina.Weapons and Items-----------------The Space Bar will make Saric thrust out his sword or dagger, if he has one.The Shift Key will make Saric use the selected alternate weapon or item. These items can range from magic spells and wands to keys and healing potions.You can select your weapons by pressing "I" at any moment during game-play. This will bring up a list of all of the items that you have. You can then select, for example, the sword you want to use by clicking on it and then pressing the "select" button. (As a short cut you can double-click on the sword/item in the list to select it.) A check-mark will appear to the left of the icon to show it’s your current weapon.Important: You must select a weapon before you can use it: nothing is automatically equipped.To find out more information about Saric you can press "S" at any moment during game-play. This will show a dialog with some statistics concerning Saric.You can acquire weapons and items from treasure chest, bags left over from dead enemies, or from people. To pick up bags and open treasure chests all you have to do is walk over them.People and Signs----------------To see what a person (or a sign) has to say, simply walk up and run into them. A box containing the message will appear. Messages tend to vary from useless to very important, so talk to everyone!Some people are merchants, and when you talk to them, a store dialog will appear. You can then use cash acquired from enemies which you have killed to purchase various types of healing potions.Extra Information-----------------To get information on your current status press the "S" key at any moment during game-play.If you forget what certain controls are you can press the "H" key for extra help.Problems: Game Play-------------------A few things which can be confusing in game play have been brought to the attention of the Syzygy Cult, so we are going to document them here:Saving: In order to save, you must first pause the game, then hit the Save button.Getting in over your head: it is possible to go the wrong direction in Mantra and enter an area where the monsters are too difficult for your current power or that of your weapons. If this happens, try exploring other areas to see if there is an easier route.Tough monsters: some monsters are just nasty! If your sword just stays out when you hold it against a monster, or if the monster does not yelp when you hit it, it is probably too tough for you. Some monsters cannot be hurt with lesser weapons, so you must wait until you acquire better swords and Mantras. Some monsters can only be killed with certain types of weapons or Mantras. There are even a few monsters which are practically immortal...Getting lost / Getting stuck: Always remember three things when you journey in Zarin: One, some boulders can be pushed, some trees conceal secret passages. Two, sometimes barriers need magic to demolish them. Three, SyzygyCult answers its email.Townspeople: Yes, they are annoying, and yes, they sometimes got in the way, so you can now kill them. Take care when you choose to do this, because some of them actually have something important to say.Leaving rooms: when you leave a room, any items in that room will be gone when you next enter the room. This can, in particular, cause trouble with the keys left behind by many boss monsters. If you do somehow manage to lose a key this way, you can send your saved game to SyzygyCult, and we will give you a key.Using Keys: Equip the key as an other weapon, walk up to a door, and hit the 'use' button. Remember, keys can only be used once.Some people have also experienced general difficulty in finding keys: again, we are able to give assistance here if you get stuck.Problems: Bugs--------------Mantra has very few known bugs and should run with no difficulty on any supported platform. That being said, if you discover any, please feel free to email us. About the Syzygy Cult (1995)----------------------------The Syzygy Cult was, in 1995, an association of six high school students, forming the Syzygy Cult itself, along with Brett Thayer who worked as an independent contractor for the Syzygy Cult. Mostly located in and around Portland, Maine, they were shocked to discover that their regionalism was shattered by the inclusion of a resident of Utah.About the Individual Members of the Syzygy Cult (bios from 1995):Dustin Mitchell is one of the main Syzygy Cult programmers. He was drawn into the Mantra project claiming "I’ll just write the blitters, and you guys can do what you want," but by the time it was all over he had worked on just about every part of Mantra. He realized he was doing too much work on the game when he dreamed repeatedly of a suitcase with its "isExplosive" bit set. He has an annoying tendency to remain on the phone with Jake for several hours at a time, sometimes stretching into those wee hours of the morning when the real programming gets done. As a matter of fact, it's 1:16 AM right now, and with just a little Pepsi he feels great! Dustin is a Junior at Waynflete High School by day, taking far too many courses to have a life this year.Jake Beal is another of the programmers for the Syzygy Cult, and holds responsibility for the Mantra MapEditor ("It work's don't it? At least sort of"). Jake lives in Portland, Maine and also goes to Waynflete High School, where he is a Junior and a fixture in the computer room. He too has had times when programming overwhelmed him and he sucessfully debugged a piece of code in a dream. Unfortunately, by the time he had started up his computer, he had forgotten. Since we still can't figure out what it was, that bug couldn't have been that bad. His other interests include theater, piano, lording his driver’s licence over other cult members, and writing.Macneil Shonle is yet another programmer for the Syzygy Cult. Also a Junior at Waynflete High School. He likes: computers, weight lifting, philosophy and hanging out. His best advice to someone is: "Take it easy," something that he himself should do more often... Anyway, things are on the up and up for him, and he looks forward to future projects from The Syzygy Cult.Gabe Ganberg is the person most directly responsible for Mantra’s plot, the actions of the monsters, and the general game design, and is also a Junior at Waynflete High School. He is not a programmer, although he plays one on TV.Ben Cote is the tallest member the Syzygy Cult. His interest including theatre, show tunes, shiny things and twiddling with his fancy hardware. His main contribution to Mantra was hanging around and bothering the programers. Not to mention dancing Irish jigs while quoting Andrew Lloyd Webber shows.Brett Thayer is a 28 year old free-lance Illustrator/Designer living in Salt Lake City, Utah (no man’s land). Graduated with a B.A. in Fine Art from the University of Utah in 1991. Brett created nearly all of the graphics for Mantra, for which the Syzygy Cult is eternally grateful.Ben Birney was born in Washington DC in 1979.  He grew up in North Yarmouth, Maine, using Apples and Macintoshes. He attended public school until eighth grade, when he finally became fed up with being taunted as a computer nerd, and transferred to Waynflete School, where he is currently a sophomore. He learned to program in C and has used his ten years of piano experience to write MODs. After finishing the MODs for Mantra, his current projects include a tactical war game, an arcade style spaceship game, and an in-play aid for Dungeons and Dragons called DM’s Aid.About the Syzygy Cult (2009)----------------------------A lot has happened since Mantra was originally released. All of the original members have now graduated from high school, and went off to pursue their lifelong passions. Some of you may be wondering, what brought these great minds back together? Here is the story, as best it can be recalled.  Sometime in the late 90's or early 2000's (who can keep track of such things), the Syzygy Cult made a website with a forum. In September of 2005, Christopher O'Neill, a loyal fan of the original game, found the site, created an account, noticed an overall lack of activity, and continued on his way. However, much to his surprise, he soon received an email from none other than Ben Birney himself! He proposed the idea of collaborating on a sequel, and Chris jumped at the opportunity. After some discussion with the other members, it was decided that there was not enough time or manpower to create a whole new game, but that it might be possible to recode Mantra to work for Mac OS X using the old code as a template.  Chris, being the sly programmer he was, rewrote the game using the Allegro Game Programming Library, so that Windows users could also enjoy the game. Some 5 years later, and after many starts and stops in progress, the game was finally ready for release. It was released for beta testing in December 2009, and released soon thereafter. Now, longtime fans and newbies alike could enjoy Mantra once again.  Below is a list of the updated Bios of the members of the Syzygy Cult, both old and new.  Dustin Mitchell: Dustin has had a varied career, teaching, administering UNIX systems, and now developing open source software.  He writes at http://code.v.igoro.us/.Jake Beal: After finishing his PhD at MIT, Jake is now a scientist a BBN Technologies, where his research focuses on engineered emergent behavior, spatial computing, and artificial intelligence.  Jake lives in Somerville, MA.  Macneil Shonle: Macneil Shonle is an assistant professor of computer science at The University of Texas at San Antonio. He is currently looking for PhD students to advise.Gabe Ganberg: Gabe Ganberg is software engineer at a research company in the Boston area by day and a martial arts instructor by night.Ben Cote: Ben Cote continues to live in southern, Maine.  He recently completed a masters degree in history and works at a local high school in Special Education.  Ben Birney: Benjamin Birney works as a software developer, participating in teams the develop custom enterprise products on a number of different platforms. He continues to love and create music, singing actively in and writing for his church choir. His musical theatre piece Sophia's Fall was an official selection of the 2008 New York Musical Theatre Festival. Ben is, through a series of unreasonable coincidences, joyfully married to Hop Nguyen. He is continually amazed by their daughter Ivy.  Thanks------The Syzygy Cult would like to extend its thanks to the following parties:- Ernest Liu for help with graphics. They would also like to thank the hard working developers of the following pieces of software, without whom this would not have been possible.  - Allegro.  After developing entirely on the Mac platform, it took less than an hour to get it up and running on Windows. Simply amazing. - libDumb.  Used for sound. Allowed us to use the original music and sound, in its original format. - libAlfont.  Used to allow a custom font.  Makes the text prettier than block test :). Thanks also to everyone who helped test.
